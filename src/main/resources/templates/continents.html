      <p>Tourism is an important economic sector for many countries in Africa. There are many countries
        that benefit heavily from tourism like Uganda, Algeria, Egypt, South Africa, Kenya, Morocco,
        Tunisia, Ghana and Tanzania.<br>
        Africa has an impressive abundance of birdlife. Some of the birds are typical African birds,
        migrant birds and others endemic to the region.
    </p>
    <p>Please feel free to explore various types of birds that are found in each of the above continents.</p>

            "Birds of Africa" redirects here. For the eponymous ornithological handbook, see The Birds of Africa.
            This is a list of the bird species recorded in Africa. The area covered by this list is the Africa region
            defined by the American Birding Association's listing rules.[1] In addition to the continent itself,
            the area includes Madagascar, Mauritius, Rodrigues, Seychelles, Cape Verde, the Comoro Islands, Zanzibar,
            and the Canary Islands, São Tomé and Príncipe and Annobón in the Gulf of Guinea. It does not include
            Socotra in the Arabian Sea, Madeira, or the Azores.

            This list is that of the African Bird Club (ABC) supplemented by Bird Checklists of the World (Avibase)
            and The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World.[2][3][4]

            This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families, and species) and
            nomenclature (common and scientific names) are those of the Clements list. Taxonomic changes are on-going.
            As more research is gathered from studies of distribution, behavior, and DNA, the names, sequence,
            and number of families and species change every year. Differences in common and scientific names between
            the Clements taxonomy and that of the ABC are frequent but are seldom noted here.
